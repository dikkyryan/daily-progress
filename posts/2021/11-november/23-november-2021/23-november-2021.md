#### What is Microsoft 365 ? 🖥💙

- [Overview](#overview)

Microsoft 365 empowers users with the latest innovation across new and familiar productivity experiences like Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Windows. Unlike other productivity services, Microsoft 365 learns from users and collects valuable insights through the Microsoft Graph to deliver enhanced experiences that continually get better over time and keep users protected.

Some Microsoft 365 components, like Microsoft 365 Apps and Windows, are delivered using the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. SaaS is software that’s centrally hosted and managed by a cloud service provider (CSP) for customers. In general, CSPs provide one version of an app for all customers and license it through a monthly or annual subscription.
