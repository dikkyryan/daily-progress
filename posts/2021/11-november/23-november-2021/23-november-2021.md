#### What is Microsoft 365 ?

- [Overview](#overview)

Microsoft 365 empowers users with the latest innovation across new and familiar productivity experiences like Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Windows. Unlike other productivity services, Microsoft 365 learns from users and collects valuable insights through the Microsoft Graph to deliver enhanced experiences that continually get better over time and keep users protected.

Some Microsoft 365 components, like Microsoft 365 Apps and Windows, are delivered using the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. SaaS is software that’s centrally hosted and managed by a cloud service provider (CSP) for customers. In general, CSPs provide one version of an app for all customers and license it through a monthly or annual subscription.

Every organization has unique requirements, so Microsoft offers a variety of subscriptions and plans to accommodate your organization’s needs. In this unit, we’ll summarize these subscriptions.

### Microsoft 365 Enterprise
Microsoft 365 Enterprise provides enterprise-class services to organizations that want a productivity solution that includes robust threat protection, security, compliance, and analytics features.
There are three available plans for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, letting you further refine what's included in your implementation - E3, E5, and F3 (formerly F1). E5 includes all of the same features as E3 plus the latest advanced threat protection, security, and collaboration tools. F3 is designed for Firstline Workers through purpose-built tools and resources that allow them to do their best work

### Microsoft 365 for business
Microsoft 365 for business is designed for small- and medium-sized organizations. Like Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft 365 for business offers the full set of Office 365 productivity tools and includes security and device management features. It doesn’t include some of the more advanced information protection, compliance, or analytics tools available to enterprise subscribers. It’s designed for organizations that need up to 300 licenses; if your organization is larger than that, you’ll have to subscribe to a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan instead.

### Microsoft 365 Education
Microsoft 365 Education is available for educational organizations and empowers educators to unlock creativity, promote teamwork, and provide a simple and safe experience in a single, affordable solution built for education. Academic licenses can be tailored to fit any institution’s needs, including productivity and security solutions for faculty, staff, and students.

### Microsoft 365 Home
Microsoft 365 Home exists to bring the same great productivity benefits into your personal and family life. Microsoft 365 Home comes in two plans: Microsoft 365 Family and Microsoft 365 Personal. Office Home and Student 2019 are available as a one-time purchase, but do not include any of the cloud benefits of Microsoft 365. Compare plans to see what plan works best for you.
