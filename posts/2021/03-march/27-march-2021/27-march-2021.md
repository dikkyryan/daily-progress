**Alibaba Cloud OceanBasePro** is a distributed relational database system that provides high performance, high availability, and scalability. The OceanBasePro SDK for Swift is a software development kit that allows developers to interact with the OceanBasePro database system using Swift programming language.

To build the Alibaba Cloud OceanBasePro SDK for Swift, follow these steps:

1.  Download and install the OceanBasePro SDK for Swift from the Alibaba Cloud website.
    
2.  Install Xcode on your Mac if you haven't already. Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS that includes a suite of software development tools.
    
3.  Open the terminal on your Mac and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the OceanBasePro SDK for Swift.
    
4.  Run the following command to build the SDK:

	`swift build`
    
5. Once the build process is complete, you can run the following command to create an Xcode project:

	`swift package generate-xcodeproj`
    
6.  Open the Xcode project by double-clicking on the ".xcodeproj" file.
    
7.  In Xcode, select the "OceanBasePro" target and build it.
    
8.  After the build process is complete, you can import the OceanBasePro SDK in your Swift project and start using it to interact with the OceanBasePro database system.
    

Note: Before using the OceanBasePro SDK for Swift, you need to configure it with your OceanBasePro database system credentials, such as endpoint URL, access key, and access secret.

In summary, building the Alibaba Cloud OceanBasePro SDK for Swift involves downloading and installing the SDK, building it using the Swift Package Manager, and creating an Xcode project to integrate it into your Swift project. With the OceanBasePro SDK for Swift, developers can interact with the OceanBasePro database system using the Swift programming language.
