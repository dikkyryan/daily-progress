Azure Virtual Network (VNet) provides a range of settings that allow you to configure and customize your network environment. Here are some key settings and options available for Azure Virtual Network:

1.  Address Space: When creating a VNet, you define an address space that specifies the range of IP addresses that can be used within the VNet. This address space can be divided into one or more subnets.
    
2.  Subnets: Subnets are subdivisions of a VNet's address space. You can create multiple subnets within a VNet, each with its own range of IP addresses. Subnets help organize and segment your network resources.
    
3.  Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs are Azure's built-in firewalling capability that allow you to filter network traffic to and from resources within a VNet. NSGs enable you to control access to your resources by defining inbound and outbound security rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
    
4.  User-Defined Routes (UDRs): UDRs enable you to control the routing of network traffic within a VNet. You can define custom routes to direct traffic to specific destinations or next hops, providing flexibility in how network traffic is directed within the VNet.
    
5.  Virtual Network Peering: Virtual Network Peering allows you to connect two VNets in the same Azure region or different regions. Peered VNets can communicate with each other as if they were on the same network, enabling secure and efficient communication between resources.
    
6.  DNS Settings: Azure VNets have built-in DNS resolution that allows resources within the VNet to resolve each other's hostnames. You can configure custom DNS settings within the VNet, including custom DNS servers or DNS suffixes.
    
7.  Service Endpoints: Service Endpoints allow you to extend your VNet's private address space to Azure service resources, such as Azure Storage or Azure SQL Database. Service Endpoints enable secure and direct connectivity to these services without the need for public IP addresses.
    
8.  ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway: Azure VNets can be connected to on-premises networks using ExpressRoute or VPN Gateway. These connectivity options provide secure and private connections between your on-premises infrastructure and Azure VNets.
    
9.  Azure Bastion: Azure Bastion is a service that provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH access to Azure virtual machines directly from the Azure portal, without the need for public IP addresses or VPN connections.
    
10.  Network Watcher: Network Watcher is a monitoring and diagnostic service that helps you monitor, diagnose, and gain insights into your Azure network resources. It provides tools for packet capture, flow logs, network topology visualization, and more.
    

These are some of the key settings and options available for Azure Virtual Network. By configuring these settings, you can customize your network environment to meet your specific networking requirements and ensure secure and efficient communication between your Azure resources.
