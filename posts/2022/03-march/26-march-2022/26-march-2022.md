# Azure Kubernetes Service

**Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance. Since Kubernetes masters are managed by Azure, you only manage and maintain the agent nodes. Thus, AKS is free; you only pay for the agent nodes within your clusters, not for the masters.

You can create an AKS cluster using:

 - [The Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli)
 - [The Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal)
 - [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell)

-   [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell)
-   Using template-driven deployment options, like [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-rm-template), [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) and Terraform.

When you deploy an AKS cluster, the Kubernetes master and all nodes are deployed and configured for you. Advanced networking, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integration, monitoring, and other features can be configured during the deployment process.z

## Access, security, and monitoring

For improved security and management, AKS lets you integrate with Azure AD to:

-   Use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC).
-   Monitor the health of your cluster and resources.

### Identity and security management

- Kubernetes RBAC
- Azure AD
- Integrated logging and monitoring

## Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure portal

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this quickstart, you will:

-   Deploy an AKS cluster using the Azure portal.
-   Run a sample multi-container application with a web front-end and a Redis instance in the cluster.

This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information,

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

-   If you're unfamiliar with the Azure Cloud Shell, review [Overview of Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).
    
-   The identity you're using to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more details on access and identity for AKS, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity).

## Create an AKS cluster

 1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
 2. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.
 3. Select **Containers** > **Kubernetes Service**.
 4. On the **Basics** page, configure the following options:
 -**Project details**:
    -   Select an Azure **Subscription**.
    -   Select or create an Azure **Resource group**, such as _myResourceGroup_.
    
	 -**Cluster details**:
	  - Ensure the the **Preset configuration** is _Standard ($$)_. For more details on preset configurations, see [Cluster configuration presets in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/quotas-skus-regions#cluster-configuration-presets-in-the-azure-portal).
    -   Enter a **Kubernetes cluster name**, such as _myAKSCluster_.
    -   Select a **Region** for the AKS cluster, and leave the default value selected for **Kubernetes version**.
    -   Select **99.5%** for **API server availability**.
  
	-**Primary node pool**:
    - Leave the default values selected.

 5. Select **Next: Node pools** when complete.
 6. Keep the default **Node pools** options. At the bottom of the screen, click **Next: Access**.
 7. On the **Access** page, configure the following options:
 -   The default value for **Resource identity** is **System-assigned managed identity**. Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. For more details about managed identities, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
-   The Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) option is the default value to provide more fine-grained control over access to the Kubernetes resources deployed in your AKS cluster.
8. Click **Review + create**. When you navigate to the **Review + create** tab, Azure runs validation on the settings that you have chosen. If validation passes, you can proceed to create the AKS cluster by selecting **Create**. If validation fails, then it indicates which settings need to be modified.
9. It takes a few minutes to create the AKS cluster. When your deployment is complete, navigate to your resource by either:

-   Selecting **Go to resource**, or
    
-   Browsing to the AKS cluster resource group and selecting the AKS resource. In this example you browse for _myResourceGroup_ and select the resource _myAKSCluster_.
