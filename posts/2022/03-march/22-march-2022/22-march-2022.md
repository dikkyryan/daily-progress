Azure VPN Gateway is a cloud-based service in Microsoft Azure that provides secure and reliable connectivity between your on-premises network and Azure virtual networks (VNets). It enables you to establish Site-to-Site (S2S) or Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN connections to securely access Azure resources.

Here are some fundamentals of Azure VPN Gateway:

1.  Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN Connections: Azure VPN Gateway allows you to establish secure IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels between your on-premises network and Azure VNets. This enables communication between your on-premises resources and resources deployed in Azure. S2S VPN connections use VPN devices or software VPN clients on-premises to connect to the VPN Gateway.
    
2.  Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN Connections: Azure VPN Gateway supports P2S connections, which enable individual client devices to securely connect to Azure resources. P2S VPN connections use the Azure VPN client or a third-party VPN client installed on the client devices. This allows remote users to access resources in Azure without requiring a direct connection to the on-premises network.
    
3.  VPN Protocols and Encryption: Azure VPN Gateway supports industry-standard VPN protocols, including Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) and Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP). These protocols ensure secure and encrypted communication between the on-premises network and Azure VNets.
    
4.  High Availability and Scalability: Azure VPN Gateway is designed to provide high availability and scalability. It supports active-active and active-passive VPN gateways, ensuring continuous availability and failover in case of hardware or software failures. VPN Gateway scales automatically based on demand, allowing you to handle increased VPN traffic as needed.
    
5.  Transit Routing: Azure VPN Gateway can be used as a transit hub for connecting multiple VNets or connecting on-premises networks with VNets. By using VPN Gateway as a transit hub, you can establish secure communication between different network environments, simplifying network architecture and reducing the need for multiple VPN connections.
    
6.  Connectivity Options: Azure VPN Gateway offers multiple connectivity options to suit your networking requirements. It supports both policy-based VPN and route-based VPN configurations. You can choose the appropriate configuration based on your VPN device capabilities and the routing requirements of your network.
    
7.  Integration with Azure Virtual Network: Azure VPN Gateway seamlessly integrates with Azure Virtual Network. It is a native Azure resource, allowing you to easily connect and configure VPN Gateway within your VNets. You can also leverage other Azure networking services, such as Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Virtual Network Service Endpoints, in conjunction with VPN Gateway for enhanced security and connectivity.
    
8.  Monitoring and Diagnostics: Azure VPN Gateway provides monitoring and diagnostics capabilities to help you troubleshoot connectivity issues and monitor VPN performance. You can use Azure Monitor to view VPN Gateway metrics, logs, and connection health. Additionally, Network Watcher provides network diagnostic tools for analyzing VPN traffic and troubleshooting network connectivity.
    

Azure VPN Gateway simplifies the process of establishing secure connections between your on-premises network and Azure VNets. By leveraging its capabilities, you can securely extend your network into Azure and enable seamless communication between on-premises resources and resources deployed in Azure.
