To provision Azure Cognitive Services using Terraform, you can follow these steps:

1.  Install Terraform: Download and install Terraform from the official website ([https://www.terraform.io/](https://www.terraform.io/)) based on your operating system.
    
2.  Set up Azure Credentials: Configure your Azure credentials to allow Terraform to interact with your Azure subscription. You can set environment variables, use Azure CLI, or provide the credentials directly in your Terraform configuration.
    
3.  Create a Terraform Configuration: Create a new directory for your Terraform project and navigate into it. Create a new file with a `.tf` extension (e.g., `main.tf`) to define your Terraform configuration.
    
4.  Define Azure Provider: In the Terraform configuration file, specify the Azure provider and version you want to use. This will enable Terraform to interact with Azure resources. Here's an example:
    

hclCopy code

`provider "azurerm" {
  version = "~>2.0"
  features {}
}` 

5.  Create an Azure Cognitive Services Resource: Define a resource block in your Terraform configuration to create an Azure Cognitive Services resource. Specify the desired settings such as the resource group, name, location, and SKU. Here's an example for creating a Text Analytics resource:



`resource "azurerm_cognitive_account" "text_analytics" {
  name                = "my-cognitive-service"
  location            = "eastus"
  resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
  kind                = "TextAnalytics"
  sku_name            = "F0"
}` 

6.  Initialize and Apply the Terraform Configuration: Run the following commands in your project directory to initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:



`terraform init
terraform apply` 

Terraform will download the necessary providers and plugins, and then prompt you to review the changes and confirm the creation of the Azure Cognitive Services resource. Enter `yes` to proceed.

7.  Verify the Provisioned Azure Cognitive Services: After the Terraform apply command completes, you can verify the provisioned Azure Cognitive Services resource in the Azure portal or using the Azure CLI.

That's it! You have now provisioned an Azure Cognitive Services resource using Terraform. You can further enhance your Terraform configuration to include additional settings or resources as per your requirements. Remember to use Terraform's plan and destroy commands for reviewing and removing resources when needed.
