Azure ExpressRoute is a cloud networking service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables you to establish private, dedicated, and high-bandwidth connections between your on-premises network and Azure data centers. It offers a more reliable and secure connection compared to traditional internet-based connections, allowing you to extend your network infrastructure into Azure.

Here are the fundamentals of Azure ExpressRoute:

1.  Private and Dedicated Connection: ExpressRoute provides a private and dedicated connection between your on-premises network and Azure. This connection is established through a physical cross-connect between your network and an Azure connectivity partner's network in a co-location facility or through a direct connection to an Azure data center.
    
2.  Connectivity Options: ExpressRoute offers multiple connectivity options to suit different network requirements. You can choose from two primary connectivity models: Network Service Provider (NSP) and Exchange Provider (IXP). NSP connections use a network service provider as an intermediary to connect to Azure, while IXP connections allow you to connect directly to Azure at an Internet Exchange Point (IXP).
    
3.  High Bandwidth and Low Latency: ExpressRoute provides high bandwidth connectivity options ranging from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps, allowing you to transfer large volumes of data between your on-premises network and Azure. It offers low latency connections, ensuring fast and responsive access to Azure services and resources.
    
4.  Enhanced Security: ExpressRoute connections are inherently more secure than internet-based connections because they do not traverse the public internet. The dedicated and private nature of the connection helps to reduce the risk of data interception or exposure. Additionally, you can further enhance security by using Azure ExpressRoute with Azure Private Link to ensure traffic stays within the Azure backbone network.
    
5.  Global Reach: ExpressRoute is available in numerous locations worldwide, allowing you to establish connections to Azure data centers across different regions. This global reach enables you to connect to Azure services and resources located in different geographical regions while maintaining high performance and reliability.
    
6.  Integration with Azure Services: ExpressRoute seamlessly integrates with other Azure services, enabling you to take advantage of a wide range of Azure capabilities. You can connect to Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and other Azure services over ExpressRoute, providing secure and private access to your resources.
    
7.  Hybrid Cloud Connectivity: ExpressRoute facilitates hybrid cloud connectivity by enabling direct and secure communication between your on-premises infrastructure and Azure. This allows you to extend your network seamlessly and build hybrid solutions that leverage the scalability and flexibility of Azure while maintaining connectivity to your existing infrastructure.
    
8.  Service Level Agreements (SLAs): ExpressRoute provides SLAs that guarantee high availability and network performance. These SLAs offer assurances for uptime, latency, and packet delivery, ensuring a reliable and consistent connection between your network and Azure.
    

By leveraging Azure ExpressRoute, you can establish a dedicated and secure connection between your on-premises network and Azure, enabling seamless integration and extending your network infrastructure into the cloud. ExpressRoute offers high performance, low latency, and enhanced security, making it suitable for scenarios where reliable and private connectivity to Azure is required.
