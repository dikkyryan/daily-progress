1.  Virtual Network (VNet): Azure Virtual Network allows you to create isolated network environments in the cloud. You can define IP address ranges, subnets, and network security groups (NSGs) to control traffic flow and secure your resources. VNets can be connected to on-premises networks through Azure ExpressRoute or VPN gateways.
    
2.  Azure Load Balancer: Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple resources or VMs to ensure high availability and scalability. It provides both internal and external load balancing options and supports TCP and UDP protocols.
    
3.  Application Gateway: Azure Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer that provides advanced application delivery and security features. It offers SSL termination, URL-based routing, session affinity, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities to optimize and protect your web applications.
    
4.  Azure Traffic Manager: Azure Traffic Manager allows you to control and distribute incoming traffic across multiple Azure regions or globally distributed endpoints. It provides load balancing based on various routing methods, such as performance, priority, or geographic proximity.
    
5.  Virtual WAN: Azure Virtual WAN simplifies the deployment and management of wide area network (WAN) connectivity. It enables you to connect your branch offices and on-premises networks to Azure using the Azure backbone network, providing a secure and optimized connection.
    
6.  Azure ExpressRoute: Azure ExpressRoute establishes a private, dedicated connection between your on-premises network and Azure data centers. It offers higher security, lower latency, and higher bandwidth compared to a typical internet connection, making it suitable for mission-critical workloads.
    
7.  Azure VPN Gateway: Azure VPN Gateway provides secure connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure VNets over the public internet. It supports both Site-to-Site VPN and Point-to-Site VPN configurations, allowing you to connect your remote offices or individual client devices securely.
    
8.  Azure Firewall: Azure Firewall is a cloud-native network security service that provides stateful firewall capabilities to protect your Azure resources. It offers application and network-level filtering, threat intelligence integration, and outbound network address translation (NAT) capabilities.
    
9.  Azure DDoS Protection: Azure DDoS Protection safeguards your applications and resources against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It provides automatic detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks, ensuring your applications remain available and performant.
    
10.  Azure Private Link: Azure Private Link enables you to securely access Azure services over a private connection. It allows you to connect to services like Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) without exposing them to the public internet.
    

These are just a few of the many networking services provided by Azure. Azure networking services offer flexibility, scalability, and security to meet a wide range of networking requirements for your cloud infrastructure.
