#### Introduction to Linux on Azure 

Microsoft Azure is a growing collection of integrated public cloud services, including virtual machines, networking, storage, databases, analytics, mobile, and web services. It enables you to build, manage, and deploy applications globally and at scale, by using your preferred tools and frameworks. But it's not just about Microsoft software: if your organization uses Linux-based development environments and runs production software on Linux, there's a place for you on Azure.

With Azure, you can power your applications with your preferred Linux distribution on Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual machine scale sets, for elasticity based on demand. The virtual network infrastructure of Azure, as well as its tools and applications, can add value to your Linux-based apps. You can also take full advantage of the unique managed service platforms (platform as a service) on Azure, to reduce the management burden of your applications without sacrificing the Linux foundation that you rely on. Microsoft is a neutral technology provider, working with all major Linux distribution partners and community distributions to offer you the most comprehensive choice of Linux and Linux-based apps.

### What is Linux on Azure?

"Linux on Azure" broadly encompasses two different kinds of Azure support for Linux applications and workloads: infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). Let's explore exactly what those terms mean, and learn more about additional Azure services and features you can take advantage of regardless of how you use Linux on Azure.

## Linux infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

With IaaS, you deploy your applications and workloads to virtual machines that run in Azure. These VMs are connected to each other and to the internet by virtual network infrastructure that you define and configure.

You can provision and manage VMs on an individual basis, or as virtual machine scale sets: groups of identical VMs managed through a central configuration interface. With scale sets, you can distribute your workloads to achieve high availability, redundancy, load balancing, and manual and automatic elastic scale.

Azure virtual machines support most common Linux distributions. Azure Marketplace has hundreds of preconfigured Linux disk images across many popular distributions, all of which include first-class Azure platform support. You can also create or migrate your own disk images, upload them to Azure, and create virtual machines from them.

IaaS is frequently the initial target for cloud migrations. The IaaS model allows you to reuse much of your on-premises architecture, while taking advantage of many benefits provided by the cloud.

## Linux platforms as a service (PaaS)

PaaS enables you to deploy applications to the cloud without managing infrastructure. These managed service platforms trade the flexibility of virtual infrastructure for reduced maintenance concerns and easier scalability. Azure PaaS services let you control, configure, and deploy your applications with the same centralized, globally available Azure Resource Manager management tools and libraries that you use for provisioning.

The Linux-based managed platforms of Azure allow you to take advantage of the benefits of PaaS, while retaining the technology foundation you're already familiar with. Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure Container Instances all support the use of Linux as their foundation. You can use these Azure services to host Linux-based applications and code natively.

If your organization uses a Linux-powered development workflow or runs production applications on Linux, you can often deploy or migrate applications to a managed Azure platform.

## Additional Azure tools and services

Regardless of whether you use IaaS or PaaS, Azure tools and services offer a lot of additional value to Linux workloads beyond the standard cloud benefits of elasticity, agility, and reduced maintenance.

## Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager provides a standard interface and set of concepts for managing every kind of Azure service and platform. Manage all of your resources and workloads in a single, browser-based graphical experience with the Azure portal. Automate resource provisioning and management from the command line with Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI, available locally and in the browser via the Azure Cloud Shell. Alternatively, you can do this from your own application code by using libraries available for most common languages. Use Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure Blueprints to perform configurable, repeatable deployments of cloud infrastructure. With broad compatibility for third-party tools, you can preserve your existing investments in tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform, and Packer.

## Azure storage services

Get durable, scalable, web-accessible storage with the core Azure storage services: Azure Blob storage for unstructured cloud-native storage; Azure File storage for mountable file shares; and Azure Queue storage for reliable messaging between applications. Mountable disk storage for virtual machines is managed just like other cloud resources, and Linux images in Azure Marketplace have all the required drivers built in. Ultra disk storage provides industry-leading throughput and sub-millisecond latency.

## Azure virtual networking and network appliances

Achieve flexible and secure communication between VMs, services, and the internet. Use network security groups and Azure Firewall for fine-grained control over the traffic in your virtual network. Direct web traffic to your applications with a comprehensive suite of load balancing and firewall services. Extend your on-premises network connectivity to Azure with Azure VPN Gateway and Azure ExpressRoute. Use HPC-grade VMs with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to drive demanding, high-performance workloads, such as weather modeling and physical simulations.

## Azure database services

Database services provide both familiar features and unique innovation in cloud-hosted databases. The Azure SQL family of products provides the SQL Server database engine in multiple forms:

- Azure SQL Database for fully managed, PaaS-style database support.
- Azure SQL Managed Instance for on-premises SQL Server compatibility with PaaS management benefits.
- SQL Server on Windows and Linux VMs for full operating system access, and complete compatibility for migration.

Azure Cosmos DB offers global distribution and multiple storage models, in a globally distributed data platform designed for the cloud. Azure Cache for Redis enables you to use the fast, well-known Redis storage server, without managing a virtual machine.

## AI and Azure Cognitive Services

Improve the intelligence of your apps with AI and Azure Cognitive Services. The search APIs of Cognitive Services provide fully managed, AI-powered search as a service. Azure Machine Learning helps developers and data scientists of all skill levels be productive, by using guided machine learning model development and drag-and-drop interaction. Azure Bot Service lets you create conversational bots to interact with your users. Azure Cognitive Services is a family of vision, speech, language, web search, and decision APIs for adding cognitive features to applications.

## Governance and monitoring

Maintain control of your applications with a comprehensive set of governance and monitoring capabilities. Monitor and optimize spending with Microsoft Cost Management budgeting and reporting capabilities. Enforce organizational standards with Azure Policy business rules and alerts. Define policy-backed resources with Azure Blueprints. Centralize monitoring, logging, and performance analysis across your entire cloud infrastructure with Azure Monitor. Instrument applications with Application Insights, perform deep queries with Log Analytics, and trigger automated actions and notifications with alerts.

## Security tools and capabilities

Build a secure foundation for your apps and workloads with security tools and capabilities in Azure. Harden your VMs and services with the recommendations provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Protect and manage secure application configuration and certificates with Azure Key Vault. Detect and respond to security incidents in real time, with the intelligent analytics of Microsoft Sentinel. Azure Active Directory provides cloud-native identity and access management for role-based access control across all of your Azure resources. Most Azure services encrypt stored data by default, including VM disks.

## Business continuity and disaster recovery

Keep your data safe and your workloads online with an Azure-supported business continuity and disaster recovery strategy. Azure Backup creates encrypted snapshot backups of all of your VMs, and supports application consistency. This ensures that applications start up as expected after restoring a snapshot. Azure Site Recovery ensures that apps and workloads remain up and running during outages, by replicating VMs across geographical regions.

## Azure Migrate

This service helps you migrate your business workloads from on-premises platforms (whether deployed on physical or virtual servers) to Azure. Use Azure Migrate tools to discover and assess on-premises VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, and physical servers, to determine whether they're ready for migration. Then, use the migration tools to test migration and migrate automatically. The Azure Migrate hub provides a centralized record of discovery, assessment, and migration activities.

### How to use Linux on Azure?

Let's get a little more detailed. Understanding more about how Linux on Azure works can help you to better envision migrating to or building for the cloud and how exactly you'd go about it.

## Linux infrastructure as a service

The core of a Linux IaaS experience is the Linux distribution you choose to run on your Azure VMs, but there's quite a bit more to IaaS than that.

## Virtual machine images

A VM image is a snapshot of a virtual machine disk, used as a template to create new VM instances. An image determines the initial contents of a VM's main disk, including its operating system and any preinstalled software and configuration.

When you create a virtual machine in Azure, you must specify the image that's used to initialize it. There are two categories of images you can choose from: ready-made, Azure Marketplace images, and custom images.

## Azure Marketplace images

Azure Marketplace is the online store for thousands of certified, open-source, and community VM images. It contains images of base Linux distributions, as well as images with preinstalled software tools installed on Linux for specific scenarios.
<br>
<img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-linux/media/marketplace.png" />
<br>
<br>

All Linux-based images on Azure Marketplace include all of the software and configuration needed to ensure smooth operation on Azure VMs. This includes kernel-level driver support for Azure infrastructure like storage and networking, as well as Azure-supported features like remote direct memory access.

Many of the images on Azure Marketplace are free to use: you pay only for the virtual infrastructure your VM consumes. Some images have additional license and purchase terms for the software they include.

You can search and browse Azure Marketplace images from the web storefront, the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.

## Custom Linux images

Creating a custom image allows you to define the software and configuration installed on your VMs to your exact specifications. Using custom images can increase the speed of your virtual machine deployments by eliminating post-deployment tasks that would otherwise be needed to prepare a VM for its desired workload.

You can create custom images by provisioning a VM based on an image from Azure Marketplace. You make modifications manually or via automation, and capture the result to a new image. You can also capture on-premises VMs to disk images and upload them to Azure. Alternatively, you can use Azure Image Builder or HashiCorp Packer to define and build custom images in a repeatable way through configuration. Microsoft also provides documentation for various Linux distributions about how to prepare an on-premises virtual machine for conversion to an Azure-compatible VM image.

If you have a large number of heavily-used custom images, and want to make them available throughout your organization, you can use shared image galleries for additional management and sharing options. Shared image galleries enable features such as global replication, high availability, versioning, and sharing within and across organizations.

## Endorsed Linux distributions

Microsoft contributes to the Linux kernel, ensuring that most newer Linux distributions are fully compatible with Azure VMs. Additionally, Microsoft maintains a list of endorsed distributions that carry additional guarantees and support when used on Azure. Microsoft has partnered with publishers of these Linux distributions to ensure a seamless Linux on Azure experience.

## Migrate on-premises Linux VMs and physical servers to Azure VMs

If your immediate concern is migrating specific workloads and applications to Azure with as little overhead as possible, you can use Azure Migrate. This service can automatically discover, assess, and migrate on-premises VMware and Hyper-V VMs, as well as physical servers. The Azure Migrate hub provides a centralized record of discovery, assessment, and migration activities. Azure Migrate also includes tools for automatically assessing and migrating databases and web applications to Azure platform as a service (PaaS) services.

## Virtual machine sizes and disks
<br>
<img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-linux/media/sizes.png" />
<br>
<br>

A VM's performance characteristics and pricing are determined by its size, which is selected independently from its image. You select a VM's size when you create it, and you can modify it at any time. Azure offers a wide variety of VM sizes, across seven different optimization categories tuned for different kinds of workloads:


- General purpose: Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers.
- Compute optimized: High CPU-to-memory ratio. Suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers.
- Memory optimized: High memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics.
- Burstable VMs: For workloads that don’t require the full CPU performance all the time. These VMs can be purchased with VM-size baseline performance. This means that if a VM is using less than the baseline, it builds up credits. When higher CPU performance is required, it can burst up to 100 percent of the vCPU.
- Storage optimized: Optimized for storage-intensive workloads. High disk throughput and input/output (I/O), ideal for big data, SQL databases, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases.
- GPU-enabled VMs: Specialized VMs targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing, as well as model training and inferencing (ND series) with deep learning. Available with single or multiple GPUs.
- High performance compute: Fastest and most powerful CPU VMs available with optional high-throughput network interfaces (remote direct memory access).

Every virtual machine you provision has a primary disk containing the boot volume with the VM's operating system, a temporary disk for short-term storage, and optional data disks for arbitrary, persistent storage. Disks are available in four performance tiers:

- Standard HDD for latency-insensitive workloads at low cost.
- Standard SSD for cost-effective, low-latency performance for workloads with relatively small data requirements.
- Premium SSD for guaranteed speed and throughput.
- Ultra disk for data-intensive workloads, such as databases.

## Scaling

Individual VMs can be scaled up and down simply by modifying their sizes, but for true, cost-effective elastic scale, use Azure virtual machine scale sets.

A scale set allows you to provision and manage a group of identical VMs. Azure can automatically provision and deprovision VMs within the scale set, by using autoscale rules based on traffic, load, and timed schedules that you define. Scale sets integrate with Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the VMs in the scale set.

Distributing an application's load across a scale set also ensures high availability. Individual VM instances that suffer from problems won't result in the application becoming completely unavailable. You can implement health checks with Azure Load Balancer to quickly detect and replace problematic instances. Scale sets also integrate with availability zones in Azure, to ensure VM instances are distributed to maximize resiliency.

## Virtual infrastructure and additional services

Provisioning for VM-based Linux workloads doesn't end with creating VMs:

- Virtual networks define how your VMs connect to each other and the internet.
- Network appliances and services, like load balancers and firewalls, let you control how traffic moves through your virtual networks.
- Cloud storage and database services, like Azure Blob storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Cache for Redis, provide storage capabilities with features that can't be achieved in an infrastructure as a service (IaaS)-only architecture.
- Application services, such as Azure Key Vault, Azure Bot Service, and Azure Cognitive Services search APIs, add features and value to apps that are otherwise IaaS-based.

All of these services and features work the same, regardless of the Linux distribution you use on your IaaS VMs.

Azure provides a dedicated library of sample architectures for your reference (see the Azure Architecture Center link in the summary of this module). With many documented reference architectures available, you should be able to find the guidance you need to design and implement secure, highly available, performant, and resilient solutions on Azure.

## Management

Use Azure Resource Manager to provision, configure, and manage all resources in Azure. This includes virtual machines, infrastructure, and all the services you'd use as part of your solution. The interface of Azure Resource Manager is a comprehensive REST API that defines actions for every kind of resource in Azure. Typically, you use this API through the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure management libraries available for multiple popular programming languages.
<br>
<img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-linux/media/manage.png" />
<br>
<br>

You can fully automate Azure Resource Manager with scripts and template files for repeatability. You can define an entire virtual environment of VMs, infrastructure, and apps in a configuration file, and deploy multiple instances of it for test and production environments.

## Linux-based platform as a serviceLinux-based platform as a service

With Linux PaaS, you deploy your applications directly to Linux-based service platforms designed to support them.

- Azure App Service is a managed web application hosting platform. App Service significantly simplifies web server management tasks and eliminates the need to configure and maintain a Linux VM deployment. Use continuous integration to deploy your web applications and services into managed, scalable Linux environments, with no downtime.

- Azure Functions provides serverless computing at the level of code. Write and deploy cloud-native, event-driven business logic and services without any concern for managing virtual infrastructure or even application platforms. With Functions, the operating system is almost entirely abstracted away from your code, but you can choose to host Functions on Linux to ensure compatibility for dependencies or configurations that require it.

- Azure Container Instances is a serverless container execution environment. With Container Instances, you can run container-based workloads without managing any compute infrastructure. Azure Kubernetes Service can use Azure Container Instances for fast and flexible scaling.

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) reduces the burden of managing a Kubernetes cluster by offloading responsibility for many critical tasks. When you deploy a cluster with AKS, Azure manages the master cluster nodes for you, and handles tasks like logging and monitoring. AKS is also tightly integrated with Azure network infrastructure.

- Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides first-class support for OpenShift container hosting on Azure. Specify and deploy scalable, resilient OpenShift clusters automatically, and let Azure manage the cluster while you focus on your container-based applications.

- Azure service platforms are all managed with the common Azure Resource Manager interface through the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, PowerShell, and management libraries available for multiple languages. Each service platform defines its own pricing and support model.
