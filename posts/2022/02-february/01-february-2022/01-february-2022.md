#### How to be a Microsoft Certified Trainer

- [Introduction](#introduction)

Many of Microsoftâ€™s software and technologies are technically complex, and professionals may require training from knowledgeable trainers in aspects of their use.

To make such training generally available, Microsoft has developed the Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) Program which grants membership to professional trainers and learning consultants who demonstrate and maintain technical and instructional expertise on Microsoft technologies and who have complied with all requirements.

### Microsoft Certified Trainer
A Microsoft Certified Trainer is a professional trainer, who has been certified by Microsoft as an expert in terms of professional knowledge and with the ability to properly share this knowledge with others. MCTs are considered the premier instructional and technical experts in all Microsoft technologies and they have the sole authority to deliver training for other Microsoft Certifications.

It is great to be a part of this community for another year and I am looking forward to meeting other MCTs.

I appreciate all the efforts that are being put into continuing to develop such great content for the official Microsoft MOCs.

### How to become an MCT
As a Microsoft Certified Trainer, you need to earn a Microsoft Certification validating your experience and knowledge in using Microsoft products and solutions for each course you deliver, as well as validating your teaching capability.

The Microsoft Certified Trainer program is an annual membership program. You must meet program requirements, complete an online application, and then pay an annual fee to apply/renew your training certification for the coming year.
If you are interested in becoming an MCT, please review the MCT Program Guide and the MCT Program Agreement below to understand the terms of membership.

The MCT program is for educators around the world who actively deliver training on Microsoft technologies. If you possess a qualifying certification and are passionate about delivering training on Microsoft technologies, I highly encourage you to consider applying.

### MCT program update
As of April 1st, 2022, the MCT program team made an announcement regarding upcoming changes to the certifications and qualifications eligibility criteria for program membership and renewals.

After receiving feedback from the community, Microsoft has reviewed the proposed changes to certifications eligible for the MCT program. They will continue to accept Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) certifications as part of the acceptance list for `existing MCTs only`.
At the time of this writing, Microsoft will NOT accept new MCTs to enter the program leveraging the MOS certifications.
