I apologize, but as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no specific Azure resource called "Defender EASM" provided by Microsoft. It's possible that this resource may have been introduced or renamed after my knowledge cutoff, or it could be a custom or third-party resource specific to your environment.

To deploy any Azure resource, you generally follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal: Go to the Azure portal ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)) and sign in with your Azure account.
    
2.  Create a resource: Click on the "Create a resource" button in the Azure portal to begin the deployment process.
    
3.  Search for the resource: In the search bar, enter the name or keywords related to the resource you want to deploy. For example, if you are looking for a security-related resource, you can search for "Azure Security Center" or "Azure Defender."
    
4.  Select the resource: From the search results, choose the resource that matches your requirements. Make sure to review the resource details, pricing, and documentation to ensure it meets your needs.
    
5.  Configure the resource: Provide the necessary configuration settings for the resource, such as a name, region, subscription, and any other required parameters. Follow the on-screen prompts and fill in the required information.
    
6.  Review and create: Review the summary of the resource deployment, including the settings you provided. If everything looks correct, click on the "Create" or "Deploy" button to start the deployment process.
    
7.  Wait for deployment: Azure will begin provisioning the resource based on your configuration. The deployment process may take a few minutes or longer, depending on the resource and its dependencies.
    
8.  Access and manage the resource: Once the deployment is complete, you can access and manage the deployed resource through the Azure portal. You can configure additional settings, monitor its performance, and integrate it with other Azure services as needed.
    

Please note that the steps outlined above are general guidelines for deploying Azure resources. The specific steps and details may vary depending on the resource you are looking to deploy. If you have more specific information about the "Defender EASM" resource, I recommend referring to Microsoft documentation, reaching out to Microsoft support, or consulting with a Microsoft representative for the most up-to-date and accurate guidance on deploying that particular resource.
