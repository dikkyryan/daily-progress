**Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS)** is a cloud-based object storage service that allows users to store, access, and manage large amounts of data in the cloud. Alibaba Cloud OSS provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool called "ossutil" which allows users to manage their OSS buckets and objects from the command line.

To create an Alibaba storage bucket from the cloud shell using ossutil, follow these steps:

1.  Open the Alibaba Cloud console and navigate to the "Cloud Shell" service.
    
2.  In the Cloud Shell, type "ossutil config" and press Enter. This will open the configuration menu for ossutil.
    
3.  Follow the prompts to configure ossutil. You will need to enter your AccessKeyId and AccessKeySecret, which can be obtained from the Alibaba Cloud console.
    
4.  Once you have configured ossutil, you can create a new bucket by typing the following command:
     `ossutil mb oss://<bucket-name>`
    
    Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name you want to give to your new bucket.
    
5.  Press Enter to execute the command. If the bucket is created successfully, ossutil will display a message confirming the creation of the bucket.
    
6.  You can verify the creation of the bucket by typing the following command:
 `ossutil ls`
    
    This will list all the buckets that are currently present in your Alibaba Cloud OSS account.

Congratulations, you have successfully created a new Alibaba Cloud storage bucket from the Cloud Shell using ossutil!
