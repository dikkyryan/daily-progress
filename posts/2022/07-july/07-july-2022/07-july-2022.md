DNAT is commonly used for scenarios such as exposing internal resources to the internet or redirecting traffic to specific servers or services.

Here are some key aspects of Azure Firewall DNAT:

1.  Inbound Traffic Redirection: DNAT enables you to redirect inbound traffic that arrives at a specific port or IP address to a different destination IP address and port within your Azure Virtual Network (VNet). This allows you to expose internal resources or services to external clients or redirect traffic to specific servers or services.
    
2.  Port Forwarding: DNAT can be used to forward traffic from a specific port on the Azure Firewall's public IP address to a designated internal IP address and port. This enables you to host services, such as web servers or application servers, behind the Azure Firewall and make them accessible from the internet.
    
3.  Load Balancer Integration: Azure Firewall DNAT can be used in conjunction with Azure Load Balancer. By configuring DNAT rules in Azure Firewall, you can redirect traffic to backend pool members behind the load balancer, providing scalability, high availability, and load balancing capabilities.
    
4.  Application Publishing: DNAT allows you to publish internal applications or services to the internet while protecting them behind the Azure Firewall. It provides a secure way to expose specific resources or services to external clients while controlling access through the firewall's rules and policies.
    
5.  IP Address Preservation: When traffic is redirected using DNAT, the source IP address is preserved, allowing the destination resource to see the original source IP of the client making the request. This feature is useful for auditing, troubleshooting, and maintaining visibility of the client's IP address.
    
6.  Rule-Based Configuration: DNAT rules are defined within Azure Firewall's rule collection. You can create rule sets to define the source IP addresses, destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols for traffic redirection. Multiple DNAT rules can be configured to handle different scenarios or applications.
    

It's important to note that Azure Firewall DNAT operates at the network layer (Layer 4) and does not inspect or modify the content of the traffic. For more advanced application-layer capabilities, you may need to combine Azure Firewall DNAT with other Azure services, such as Azure Application Gateway or Azure Traffic Manager.

By leveraging Azure Firewall DNAT, you can securely expose internal resources or services, redirect traffic to specific destinations, and maintain control over inbound traffic in your Azure environment.
