Deploying FortiGate-VM in High Availability (HA) mode on Alibaba Cloud between availability zones involves setting up a pair of FortiGate virtual machines (VMs) in different zones and configuring them to work together in active-passive mode.

Here are the steps to deploy FortiGate-VM in HA mode on Alibaba Cloud:

1.  Launch FortiGate-VM instances: First, launch two FortiGate-VM instances in different availability zones in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Make sure to select the appropriate image and instance type for your needs.
    
2.  Configure FortiGate-VM instances: After launching the instances, log in to each FortiGate-VM instance and configure the network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing according to your network topology. Make sure that the interfaces are in the same subnet and can communicate with each other.
    
3.  Set up HA heartbeat interface: Create a new interface on both FortiGate-VM instances and configure it as the HA heartbeat interface. This interface will be used for communication between the active and passive FortiGate-VMs.
    
4.  Configure HA cluster: On one FortiGate-VM instance, configure the HA cluster by going to System > HA and selecting "Create New." Enter the IP addresses of the two FortiGate-VM instances and select the HA heartbeat interface.
    
5.  Synchronize configuration: After configuring the HA cluster, synchronize the configuration between the active and passive FortiGate-VMs. This can be done by selecting "Sync Configuration" from the HA menu.
    
6.  Test failover: Once the configuration is synchronized, test the failover by disconnecting the network cable from the active FortiGate-VM instance or by shutting it down. The passive FortiGate-VM instance should take over as the active instance.
    
7.  Configure security group: Finally, configure the security group to allow traffic between the FortiGate-VM instances and the rest of the network. This can be done by creating rules to allow traffic on the necessary ports and protocols.
    

That's it! You have successfully deployed FortiGate-VM in HA mode on Alibaba Cloud between availability zones. This configuration provides high availability and redundancy for your network security.
