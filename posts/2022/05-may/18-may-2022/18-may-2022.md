1.  Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring service that provides visibility into the performance, availability, and health of your Azure resources and applications. It collects telemetry data from various sources, such as virtual machines, containers, applications, and Azure services, and offers features like metrics, logs, alerts, and dashboards. Azure Monitor enables you to monitor and diagnose issues in real-time, gain insights from collected data, and take proactive actions to optimize resource performance.
    
2.  Azure Operations Management Suite (OMS): Azure Operations Management Suite is a collection of management services that provides enhanced monitoring, automation, and analytics capabilities for hybrid cloud environments. It includes features like log analytics, automation, backup, security, and disaster recovery. With OMS, you can monitor resources both in Azure and on-premises, centralize log management, automate routine tasks, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
    

While Azure Monitor focuses on monitoring Azure resources and applications, OMS extends the monitoring capabilities to hybrid environments, allowing you to monitor both Azure and on-premises resources from a single console. OMS also provides additional management and automation features beyond monitoring.

It's worth noting that the Azure portal provides a unified experience for accessing both Azure Monitor and Azure Operations Management Suite. From the Azure portal, you can access and configure monitoring settings for your Azure resources, set up alerts, view performance metrics and logs, and leverage automation and management capabilities provided by OMS.

In summary, Azure Monitor and Azure Operations Management Suite are two complementary services that offer monitoring, management, and automation capabilities for Azure resources and hybrid cloud environments. They help organizations ensure the availability, performance, and security of their applications and infrastructure deployed on Azure.
