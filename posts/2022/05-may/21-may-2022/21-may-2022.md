![ECS](https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1ipoGzUT1gK0jSZFrXXcNCXXa-200-200.png_.webp)Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service (ECS) is a cloud-based computing service that provides scalable computing resources for various applications. ECS instances are virtual machines that can be accessed remotely via SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. Here are the steps to configure SSH for an Alibaba ECS instance:

1. Create an ECS instance: First, you need to create an ECS instance on Alibaba Cloud. Make sure to choose the appropriate operating system image for your needs, such as Ubuntu or CentOS.

2. Configure security group: After creating the instance, you need to configure the security group to allow SSH access. Go to the ECS dashboard and navigate to the "Security Groups" section. Click on "Create Security Group" and select the appropriate options, such as allowing inbound SSH traffic on port 22. Then, attach the security group to your ECS instance.

3. Obtain the instance public IP address: To connect to the ECS instance via SSH, you need to know the public IP address of the instance. You can find this information on the ECS dashboard by clicking on the instance name and navigating to the "Network Interfaces" section.

4. Connect to the instance via SSH: Open your preferred SSH client and enter the following command in the terminal:
    ```ssh username@public_ip_address```

Replace "username" with the appropriate username for your instance and "public_ip_address" with the IP address obtained in the previous step. You may be prompted to enter a password or key passphrase, depending on your SSH configuration.

Configure SSH for increased security: It is recommended to configure SSH for increased security by disabling root login and enabling key-based authentication. To do this, edit the SSH configuration file located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config and make the following changes:

```PermitRootLogin no```
```PasswordAuthentication no```
```PubkeyAuthentication yes```

Save the changes and restart the SSH service by running the following command:
```sudo service sshd restart```

That's it! You have successfully configured SSH on your Alibaba ECS instance.
