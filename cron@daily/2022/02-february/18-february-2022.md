### Wayang Linux

Linux is an Open Source operating system that allows users to create and customize their own. Remaster and Linux From Scratch are two approaches for creating your own operating system on the Linux operating system. 
The distinction is that the Remaster approach builds or modifies an existing operating system, whereas the Linux From Scratch method creates an operating system from the ground up. The goal of this study is to create a Wayang operating system using the Linux From Scratch method, as well as a legal operating system that can be used for penetration testing and other software requirements.
